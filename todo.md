- Chord(['C', 'G', 'Eb','Bb']) return Cm7
- Fix Demos

- add scale.relativeModes:\
e.g. for C major:\
D dorian E phrygian F lydian G mixolydian A minor B locrian
- add scale.parallelModes:\
e.g. for C major:\
C major C dorian C phrygian C lydian C mixolydian C minor C locrian
- add % or / to repeat chord



Notes:
- Tritone substitution: we can replace a dom7 by a dom7 that is 6halfSteps above the root
- Tritone substitution is good on II-V-I because it provides a chromatic root movement
  e.g. Dm7–G7–CM7 -> Dm7–D♭7–CM gives a downward walking bass
- Guide Tones are the 3rd and the 7th of a chord. They are the most harmonically important as they 
   determine its quality, so we want to focus on them
- Avoid notes are notes located one step above a given chord's notes
