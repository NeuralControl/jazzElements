Why Invert Rootless Voicings?   
You might be wondering why we invert rootless voicings and the answer is so that we can play them in the correct register of the piano. Rootless voicings sound best when played right in the centre of the piano (around middle C). If you play rootless voicings too low on the keyboard they will sound ‘muddy’ and distorted. If you play them too high they will sound very ‘thin’.
By inverting rootless voicings you can always play them on or close to the centre of the piano to get the best sound.
Rootless Voicings For Dominant Chords   
Rootless dominant 7th voicings are a bit trickier than major and minor chords. We could voice them in the same way that we have voiced the major and minor chords. However, this would not voice lead smoothly in the context of a 251 progression.
Instead we substitute the 5th for the 13th. This creates tension and dissonance between the 13th and then b7th .
- Tritone substitution: we can replace a dom7 by a dom7 that is 6halfSteps above the root   
- Tritone substitution is good on II-V-I because it provides a chromatic root movement   
  e.g. Dm7–G7–CM7 -> Dm7–D♭7–CM gives a downward walking bass   
- identify pivot chord in modulations
