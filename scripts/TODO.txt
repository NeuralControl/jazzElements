# todo: Check the following
In addition to IIm7-V7-Is created through secondary dominants, many tunes are made up of IIm7-V7-Is with different key centres that may appear to be entirely random or may be related logically:
Misty: key centres in bridge move down a semitone then a major 3rd
Autumn Leaves: key centres Bb – Gm (major to relative minor)
Giant Steps: (key centres move up in major 3rds)


NOTES ON JazzPianoSite

Chord Substitutions:
====================

    Chords can be substituted if the substitute chord contains its 3rd and 7th as the two chords will have a similar feel
    Substitution Types:
    - MedianNoteSubstitution on any chord:           
        We take ths chord starting from the median note 
        we can do a 3 note or 4 note chord
        We can go a third up or a third down (major only?)
        ex CMaj7 -> Em7 or Am7          3sub
        ex Am7 -> CMaj7 or FMaj7        3sub
        
        => Easy to do from Scale
             
    - 25 substitution:
        ex G7 -> Dm7 G7                 25sub5
        ex G7 -> Em7 A7 | Dm G7         6325sub5
        
    - 25dom substitution: (instead of playing the sub we play the dominant sub)
        ex G7 -> D7 G7                  25domsub
        ex G7 -> E7 A7 | D7 G7          6325domsub
        
    - #Vdim7 substitution in place of a DOM:
        G7 -> G#dim7                    interesting
        
    - Tritone Substitution in place of a DOM:
        ex G7 -> Db7                    3sub already in chord, add to search
         
    examples:
        org:           '|Dm7|G7|CM7|'               # original progression 
        substitution1: '|Dm11|Db9|CM13#11|'         # alt|tritone|alt
        substitution2: '|FM9|G13|Am9|'              # medianNote|alt|medianNote
        substitution3: '|Em11,A7b9|Dm11,G7b9|CM9|'  # ???|2-5sub|alt
        substitution4: '|Bm7b5|Bo7|Am7|'            # medianNote|#Vdim7|medianNote
        
    todo: check for Tritone substitution: (trit is in Chords)
        - Tritone substitution: we can replace a dom7 by a dom7 that is 6halfSteps above the root
        - Tritone substitution is good on II-V-I because it provides a chromatic root movement
          e.g. Dm7–G7–CM7 -> Dm7–D♭7–CM gives a downward walking bass

Passing Chords
=============
    Passing chords a chords that you pass by. 
    - They dont last normally more than .5 bar
    - They are inserted between two important chords (beat 1 or 3 of a bar)
    - can be diatonic or non diatonic


Approach Chords
===============
    https://www.jazzguitar.be/blog/take-the-a-train-jazz-guitar-chord-study/
    Approach Chords (App.): These are chords which approach the next diatonic chord in
    the tune by either a half step below or half step above that resolution chord.
    
    it is a type of passing chord that is either 1 (chromatic) or 2 (diatonic) semitones away from the next chord
    
    examples:
        Original Chord Progression	| CMaj7 | Dm7 ||
        Tritone (of previous chord)	| CMaj7 - G♭7 | Dm7 ||
        Tritone (of next chord)	| CMaj7 - A♭7 | Dm7 ||
        Approach #1 (diatonic)	| CMaj7 - Em7 | Dm7 ||
        Approach #2 (semitone)	| CMaj7 - D♭7 | Dm7 ||          
        Approach #3 (semitone)	| CMaj7 - E♭7 | Dm7 ||          
        Diminished #1	| CMaj7 - D♭o7 | Dm7 ||
        Diminished #2	| CMaj7 - E♭o7 | Dm7 ||
        Dominant-minor	| CMaj7 - D7 | Dm7 ||
        Secondary V	| CMaj7 - A7 | Dm7 ||
        Secondary II, V	| CMaj7 - Em7 A7 | Dm7 ||

Tonicization/Modulation
=======================
    Modulation: changing the key for over two bars
    Tonicization: changing key for less than two bars
    - we cant tonicize the tonic (it is already)
    - we cant tonicize a hdim
    - only maj and min chords can be tonics, so we can only tonicise them

    two ways of tonicization:
    - insert a secondary dominant
    - insert a secondary leading tone (viihdim7 or viio7)
    examples:
    Original Chord Progression	        |CMaj7|Am7         |Dm7|G7|
    Secondary Dominant	  	            |CMaj7|A7          |Dm7|G7|
    Secondary Leading-Tone Chord	    |CMaj7|C#ø7 OR C#o7|Dm7|G7|
    
    Cycling Secondary Dominant	                    |CMaj7,B7|Em7,A7|Dm7,G7|CMaj7|
    Cycling Secondary Dominant without resolving	|CMaj7,B7|E7,A7|D7,G7|CMaj7|
    Secondary ii, V	                                |CMaj7|Em7,A7|Dm7|G7|
    Chromatic Cycling Secondary ii, V               |Em7,A7|E♭m7,A♭7|Dm7|G7|

Modal Interchange (borrowed chords):
====================================
    Changing key for a chort period while retaining the same tonal center (root)
    in modal interchange, we borrow chords from a parallel key
    
    examples:
        |Dm7|G7|CMaj7|          # original 251
        |Dm7♭5|G7♭9|CMaj7|      # Borrowed from harmonic minor
        |Gm7|CMaj7|Dm7♭5|       # Borrowed from Aeolian	
        |D♭Maj7|Gm7♭5|CMaj7|    # Borrowed from Phrygian
        |D7|GMaj7|CMaj7|        # Borrowed from Lydian
    
    examples:
        mode | modal interchange        | Songs
        Aeo  | Minor iv,♭VII7,♭VI,♭III   | All The Things You Are, I Got Rhythm, There will never be another you, My Romance, 
                                          Lament,Lady Bird,Misty,Cherokee
        hmin | Minor II-V               | Alone Together, What is this thing called love?, You Go To My Head
        Mixo | I7                       | Every Blues Song, I Got Rhythm, Alone Together
        
    
    example: i got rhythm
        |B♭6,Gm7|Cm7,F7|B♭6,Gm7|Cm7,F7|
        |B♭6,<B♭7>|E♭6,<E♭m7>|B♭6,Gm7|Cm7,F7|
    - Bb7 and Emb7 are borrowed from Bb mixo and Bb aeo modes
    - they are surrounded by chords from bb major on both sides
    - it lasts only for 1 bar
    - the tonal center still sounds like Bb
    
    
Types of Modulation:
====================
    - unprepared or direct: We go straight to a I chord. often between sections
    - prepared: we prepare using a V or II-V 
        example: how high the moon: |GMaj7|GMaj7| <Gm7|C7> |FMaj7|FMaj7| <Fm7|B♭7> |E♭Maj7|
    - pivot chord: using a diatonic common to the two keys
        example: |Dm7 | G7 | CMaj7 | <Em7> | A7 | DMaj7 | # 251 in C then 251 in D with Em7 as pivot
        example: automn leaves  |Cm7 | F7 | B♭Maj7 | <E♭Maj7> | Am7♭5 | D7 | Gm7 | Gm7 |
    - transitional/chain: succession of 2-5 to move quickly through keys, moving down by semitone, tone or fifth
        example: blues for alice         |FMaj7 | Em7♭5,A7 | Dm7,G7 | Cm7,F7 | B♭7 |
        example: In Your Own Sweet Way:  |Am7♭5,D7 | Gm7,C7 | Cm7,F7 | B♭6 ||
    
    Most modulations change key to:
        - relative minor or major
        - parallel minor or major
        - a key closed related on the circle of fifth do many notes in common
        
        
LOOK FOR TONICIZATION BEFORE CONCLUDING FOR MODULATION, LOOK FOR 
- secondary dominants
- borrowed chords
- chord substitution
- passing chords

Modes feel
==========
    Modes feel  (https://endofthegame.net/2011/07/28/modesmajorscale/)
    Ionian – Very clean sounding, almost to the point of sounding sterile. Your Grandma would love this one.
    Dorian – Can sound smooth and soulful or hip and bluesy, depending on how you use it.
    Phrygian – Has a very Middle-Eastern or Spanish sound.
    Lydian – Very clean, like Ionian, but the #4 gives it a more spacey, unresolved quality.
    Mixolydian – “Funky” or “folky”, depending on how it’s used. This mode has been used for everything from old sea chanteys to a lot of 70’s rock tunes.
    Aeolian – Dark and sad like those old cowboy songs, or tough and mean as used in a lot of heavy rock songs.
    Locrian – The real ear-twister of the bunch. Can sound Spanish like Phrygian, but much darker and more unresolved.

# todo: WALK THAT BASS Harmonic Analysis of the chord progression
Following WalkThatBass:
http://www.thejazzpianosite.com/jazz-piano-lessons/jazz-chord-progressions/how-to-analyse-a-chord-progression-harmonic-analysis/

Level 1:
- Find the most represented key
- Annotate chords using this key
Level 2:
- Annotate Function: (PD,D,T)
- Annotate Second Level Chords
    Everything before PD-D-T is a Tonic Prolongation (prolongs the tonic without a cadence)
    They can be Substitutions, or Quick Passing Chords
- Look for non-diatonic chords:
    Long period (>1bar): Modulation
    Short Period (.5-1 bar): Passing Chord | Borrowed Chord | Secondary Dominant

Improvisation:
- first level: We can use the relevant mode under each chord, but we change scale all the time
- or in the second level: We use the functionally important chords
then we can go into crazy stuff i.e. side slipping, cycled patterns, chromatic runs etc...
